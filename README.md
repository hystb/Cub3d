| [exit_exec.c](https://github.com/hystb/Cub3d/blob/main/src/exit/exit_exec.c)       | The code snippet provides a function called free_exec_struct that frees memory allocated for various data structures and returns 0. It takes as input a player struct (including position and rcast fields), a data_game struct, and a string. The function frees memory for the player struct attributes, including rcast, and destroys the associated image data. Finally, it cleans the data_game struct and returns 0.                                                                  |
| [exit_parsing.c](https://github.com/hystb/Cub3d/blob/main/src/exit/exit_parsing.c) | The provided code snippet includes functions related to error handling and memory management.1. The function `map_path_is_not_correct` prints an error message and exits if an incorrect map path is provided.2. The function `clean_data` destroys images and display resources, frees memory, and exits with an error message if provided.3. The function `free_map` frees memory allocated for a 2D map array.These functions help in proper cleanup and handling of errors in the code. |

It then calls functions to calculate the ray's depth horizontally and vertically, and chooses the closer depth value. Based on the angle of the ray, it updates the face value to determine the hit direction. Finally, it adjusts the hit point and calculates the result based on the player's viewing angle. |
| [utils.c](https://github.com/hystb/Cub3d/blob/main/src/exec/utils.c)         | This code snippet offers several utility functions:-`get_rad` converts an angle in degrees to radians.-`ft_free` safely frees a memory pointer.-`readjust_point` adjusts x and y coordinates based on the ray's angle and direction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [collision.c](https://github.com/hystb/Cub3d/blob/main/src/exec/collision.c) | The code snippet provides functions for checking if a given coordinate on a map is a block ('1') or a wall. It also checks if a point is within the boundaries of the map.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [inits.c](https://github.com/hystb/Cub3d/blob/main/src/exec/inits.c)         | This code snippet initializes the structure and allocates memory for the player and various components such as position, raycasting, and image data. It also sets up the player's initial view and position. Finally, it creates the necessary MLX tools like a window and image for rendering.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
